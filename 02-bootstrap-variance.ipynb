    "## Abstract\n",
    "Science tests competing theories or models by evaluating the similarity of their predictions against observational experience. \n",
    "Thus, how we measure similarity fundamentally determines what we learn.\n",
    "In machine learning and scientific modeling, similarity metrics are used as objective functions.\n",
    "A classic example being mean squared error, which is the optimal measure of similarity when errors are normally distributed and independent and identically distributed (iid). \n",
    "In many cases, however, the error distribution is neither normal nor iid, so it is left to the scientist to determine an appropriate objective.\n",
    "Here, we review how information theory can guide that selection, then demonstrate the approach with a simple hydrologic model."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Science seeks to create useful representations of reality in the form of hypotheses, models, or theories.\n",
    "What sets science apart from other pursuits is that it rigorously tests those representations against observational experience,\n",
    "favoring those that best fit the evidence.\n",
    "An analogous process occurs when calibrating a numerical model or evaluating among competing models.\n",
    "To select the ``best'' model, experiment by varying the model while keeping the test data and objective fixed.\n",
    "If mean squared error (MSE) is the objective, compute the MSE between the test data and the model predictions, then select the model with the lowest MSE.\n",
    "But why choose MSE and not another objective function?\n",
    "The answer: MSE is the optimal measure when errors are normally distributed and iid.\n",
    "But for many problems, the true error distribution is complex or unknown.\n",
    "Rather than simply assuming some de facto objective function, \n",
    "compare them against the evidence.\n",
    "This paper demonstrates how.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select the best objective, the experiment is essentially the same except the objective is varied while the model and data are held fixed.\n",
    "Now, select the objective indicating the greatest similarity between data and model.\n",
    "Different objective functions have different scales, so they are normalized\n",
    "such that each integrates to one, thereby representing them as probability distributions.\n",
    "The normalized form of MSE is the normal distribution, for example (Hodson, 2022).\n",
    "When used to evaluate model fit, the probability distribution is called a likelihood function\n",
    "and its output the likelihood.\n",
    "So, to select among objectives, compare their likelihoods, and favor the most likely.\n",
    "Taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood, denoted as $\\ell$,\n",
    "does not change the models ranks\n",
    "but simplifies the math by converting products to sums:\n",
    "likelihoods multiply, so log likelihoods add.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to benchmark objectives, compare their log likelihoods.\n",
    "The maximum likelihood estimators for the log likelihoods of several objectives are implemented below."
