# Workflow for benchmarking objectives
This repository demonstrates a workflow for benchmarking objective functions based on their likelihoods (or information content).
It was developed as part of the U.S. Geological Survey (Hydro-terrestrial Earth Systems Testbed (HyTEST) project.
The repository contains two python notebooks; most users should begin by reading the second notebook:
[01-objective-benchmark-demo](https://code.usgs.gov/wma/hytest/workflow-hodson-2022-objective-benchmark/-/blob/main/01-objective-benchmark-demo.ipynb)).
Additional information and link to an accompanying paper will appear here in due course.
